<p>Originally from Colombia, Tatiana relocated to Bogotá at a young age, where her innate curiosity about the world began to take shape. This early passion for exploration fueled extensive travels throughout adulthood, ultimately inspiring a bold move to New York City in pursuit of her dream to become a fashion designer.
As Tatiana’s journey unfolded, her interests evolved, leading her to study communications. This academic path opened the door to digital marketing—a field where she discovered a deep passion for crafting compelling narratives and building authentic connections with diverse audiences. Alongside this professional growth, Tatiana also developed a keen interest in coding and technology, continually expanding her versatile skill set in today’s digital landscape.
Having navigated the challenges and opportunities of being an immigrant, Tatiana understands the resilience required to adapt, reinvent oneself, and pursue new ambitions. Her journey reflects a commitment to growth, adaptability, and the courage to embrace change. Tatiana believes that success is not just about following a fixed path, but about evolving with purpose and an open mind.
